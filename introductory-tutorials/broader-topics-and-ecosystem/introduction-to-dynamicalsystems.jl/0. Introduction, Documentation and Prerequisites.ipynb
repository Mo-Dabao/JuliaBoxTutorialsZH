    "\n",
    "**DynamicalSystems.jl** is a Julia software library for the exploration of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents of these tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to create a dynamical system and get a trajectory out of it.\n",
    "3. Orbit diagrams & Poincar√© surfaces of section of a dynamical system.\n",
    "4. Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system.\n",
    "5. Entropies and dimensions of numerical data.\n",
    "6. Delay coordinates embedding & Neighborhoods.\n",
    "7. Quick summary of the rest of the features possible with **DynamicalSystems.jl**: \n",
    "    * Lyapunov exponent from numerical data\n",
    "    * Broomhead-King coordinates\n",

    "## About DynamicalSystems.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DynamicalSystems.jl** has been built from the ground up with the principles of clarity, intuition and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aims to be a \"library\" in the literal sense: all offered functionality is well documented and accompanied with descriptions of the algorithms as well as references to original papers. This offers new users plenty of chances to learn new algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "**DynamicalSystems.jl** is in v1.0-alpha! Comments, testing, suggestions etc. are very welcome before official release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any changes that will happen for v1.0 release will be summarized in the [News page](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/latest/news/).\n",

    "# Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/latest/.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same documentation page you will find a [list of contents](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/latest/#contents).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions, you can open issues in the appropriate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics); if you think your question is minor, don't hesitate to chat with us over [gitter](https://gitter.im/JuliaDynamics/Lobby).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DynamicalSystems.jl** is a registered package. On Julia v0.6 you only have to type `Pkg.add(\"DynamicalSystems\")` to install its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions that are exported by **DynamicalSystems.jl** have very detailed documentation strings. \n",
    "* Simply press `?` followed by the function name to see the documentation strings!\n",

    "# About this tutorial series\n",
    "Tutorials 1-4 are intended for any audience *but* with some prior exposure to math and physics, as outlined in the prerequisites. In these tutorials, the methods shown will be explained and discussed in detail, so people unfamiliar with nonlinear dynamics and chaos can still follow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorials 5 and onwards will target more a experienced audience. These tutorials will provide example applications, but will not explain the methods/algorithms used. This is so that we can demo the available features in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, don't feel worried if you are not able to fully grasp all concepts at that point!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial series assumes some basic knowledge of Julia & physics/mathematics concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia\n",
    "    * [Functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/functions/#man-functions-1).\n",
    "    * [Broadcasting](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/arrays/#Broadcasting-1) (\"vectorizing\" function application).\n",
    "    * [Methods](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/methods/#Methods-1) and multiple dispatch. This also relies on basic knowledge of the [Type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/types/#man-types-1) system.\n",
    "    * Basic handling of vectors and matrices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Mathematics/Physics\n",
    "    * State-space & trajectory of a dynamical system\n",
    "    * What does it mean for a trajectory to be periodic\n",
    "    * Jacobians & linearized dynamics\n",
