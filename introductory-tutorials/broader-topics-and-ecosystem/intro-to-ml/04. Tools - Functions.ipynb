A **function** is one of the most fundamental concepts in computing (and also in mathematics). \n\nA function is a piece of a program that receives **input arguments**, processes them by doing certain calculations on them, and returns **outputs**.\n\nFor example, we might have a function `g` that takes a number as an input and returns the square of that number as an output. How can we define this function `g` on a computer? Julia gives us a few different ways to do this."
