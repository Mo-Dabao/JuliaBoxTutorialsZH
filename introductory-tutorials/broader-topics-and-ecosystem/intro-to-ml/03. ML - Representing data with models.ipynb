In our minds we ignore the background and say \"the banana is bright yellow, the apple is dark red\", but a computer just has a bundle of numbers and does not know where it should be looking.\n\nThe other issue is that \"bright yellow\" isn't a color that exists in a computer. The computer has three colors: red, green, and blue. \"Bright yellow\" in a computer is a mixture of red and green, and it just so happens that to get this color yellow, it needs more red than the apple!"

This means that when we write the string using quotation marks (`\"  \"`), we insert a placeholder for some **value** we want the string to include. When the string is evaluated, the value we want the string to include replaces the placeholder. For example, in the following string,\n\n```julia\nmystring = \"The average value of red in the apple is $apple_red_amount\"\n```\n\n`$apple_red_amount` is a placeholder for the value stored in the variable `apple_red_amount`. Julia knows that we want to use the value bound to the variable `apple_red_amount` and *not* the word \"apple_red_amount\" because of the dollar sign, `$`, that comes before `apple_red_amount`."

But how do we calculate that size?\n- We could use another color, or combinations of colors, from the image. Which colors?\n\nLet's go with the last route.
