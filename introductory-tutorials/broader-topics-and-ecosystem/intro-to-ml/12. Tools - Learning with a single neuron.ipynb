We will have many input data, labelled with an index $i$. We will denote the $i$th data point as  $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$.\n\nThe goal is that our neuron will take a single point on the two-dimensional plane as its input, and should return a single output that **classifies** it as an apple ($0$) or a banana ($1$). \n\nTo do so, it must \"**learn**\" the correct values of its parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$. For this learning to take place, we'll need **labels** for each of the input data, which identify them as either an apple (0) or as a banana (1). \n\nThese labels will, in turn, allow us to create a loss function, which will allow our algorithm to learn to determine if a given choice of parameters does a good or a poor job of classifying our fruit images. \n\n**So what do we have left to do?**\n\nThe above might sound complex, but luckily we can break it down into a series of actionable steps:\n\n1. Clean our input data (amounts of red and green) to get it into a usable format;\n2. Create a sequence of labels that we can use to identify correct and incorrect classifications;\n3. Define a loss function that contains parameters;\n4. Implement an algorithm to pick parameters for our neuron by minimizing the loss function with respect to the parameters;\n5.
