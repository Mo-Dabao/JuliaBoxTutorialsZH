Furthermore, if we want to do the same thing with many pieces of data, it's much easier to put all of these pieces of data in one place to work with them at once.\n\nFor example, we may want to multiply `a`, `b`, and `c` by `2`. We could multiply three times:\n\n```julia\na * 2\nb * 2\nc * 2\n```\n\nOr, instead, we could create one array (let's call it `numbers`) and multiply that array by `2`:\n```julia\nnumbers * 2\n```\n\nThe syntax for creating this array, `numbers`, is\n\n```julia\nnumbers = [a, b, c]\n```\n\nOr, we could have just written\n\n```julia\nnumbers = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that in Julia, 1-dimensional arrays are also called \"vectors\"."
