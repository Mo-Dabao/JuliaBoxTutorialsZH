What we need to do is incorporate more ideas into our model by allowing more inputs. However, more inputs would mean more parameters to play with. Also, we would like to have the computer start \"learning\" on its own, instead of modifying the parameters ourselves until we think it \"looks right\". How do we take the next step?\n\nThe first thing to think about is, if you wanted to incorporate more data into the model, how would you change the sigmoid function? Play around with some ideas. But also, start thinking about how you chose parameters. What process did you do to finally end up at good parameters? These two problems (working with models with more data and automatically choosing parameters) are the last remaining step to understanding deep learning."
